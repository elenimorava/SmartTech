# About Us

## Company Overview

 Our company started in September 2018 in Tirana, Albania founded by Italian and Albanian shareholders. Smart-Tech operates in the field of Software Engineering, to provide information technology solutions for small to big-sized businesses.
          Our customers are mainly located in Italy and Albania and come from many different sectors, but regardless of their industry, they share the same great challenge: They must design their IT infrastructure, in order to fulfill their business requirements and reduce costs at the same time. Whenever the topic is information technology, Smart-Tech is the right choice.
          The company operates by offering its services mainly to the private sector such as Call Center, Finance and IT Outsourcing.
